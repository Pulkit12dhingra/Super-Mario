# Super-Mario
Mario using python

Yeahhh...!!, that good old legend game is Back 


Super Mario is the world's most famous game, You maybe from any age group but you would know about super mario.
I tried to mimic that madness if the game using Python.
I thank Mr Amit Kumar Sir (CETPA Infotech Lucknow) for guiding me in this project.
It was really one of my dream projects. 
I am being a little too lazy but github says Wow max 100 files only so despite of distributing the files I decided to upload it on my drive and share a link connection to it.
The file is not that big just 12.4 MB so you may Download and run it.
Make sure to check the path of the data file before running the project.
